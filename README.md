Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of three different diseases - diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease - based on relevant health data. Machine learning models have been trained and integrated into a Streamlit application for easy and interactive prediction.

Setup and Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/multiple-disease-prediction-system.git cd multiple-disease-prediction-system

Install the necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Disease Prediction Systems
This project includes prediction systems for three diseases:

Diabetes Prediction System
Heart Disease Prediction System
Parkinson's Prediction System
Each prediction system contains model training scripts, model evaluation scripts, preprocessing scripts, and the trained model files.

Streamlit Application
The Streamlit application is located in the app/ directory. 
The application provides an intuitive interface for users to input health data and obtain predictions for the respective diseases.

To run the Streamlit application, use the following command:

streamlit run app/app.py

Usage
Run the Streamlit application as described above.
Access the application in your web browser.
Input the necessary health data for the respective disease prediction.
Obtain the prediction results.
